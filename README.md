Latex template use for my PhD thesis. Previous versions were used for my Bachelor and Master thesis.

Anything that requires attention (*e.g.* changing author name) is marked with 'TODO'.

Initially based on a layout from E. Kloppmann (thanks!) and since changed to taste and need with various bits from the internet as required. If I were to start from scratch at this point I would switch to biblatex and maybe also to lualatex.

Required packages should all be part of a recent version of texlive-full, the ones most likely to miss in older versions are [minted](https://ctan.org/pkg/minted?lang=en) and [gitinfo2](https://ctan.org/pkg/gitinfo2?lang=en).
