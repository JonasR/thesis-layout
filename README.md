Current state of my Latex thesis-layout. Previous versions were used for my Bachelor and Master thesis.

Anything that requires attention (*e.g.* changing author name) is marked with 'TODO'.

Initially based on a layout from E. Kloppmann (thanks!) and since changed to taste and need with various bits from the internet as required.

Required packages should all be part of a recent version of texlive-full, the ones most likely to miss in older versions are [minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted) and [gitinfo](https://github.com/mpg/git-info).
